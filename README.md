# Eye_Disease_prediction
Developed a full-stack eye disease prediction app using React.js, Flask, and TensorFlow. Utilized CNN models (VGG16, ResNet50, custom CNNs) to classify retinal images. Integrated image upload with react-dropzone, responsive UI with MUI, and real-time predictions via RESTful APIs.
